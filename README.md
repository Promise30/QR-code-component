# TOOLS

This project was built using:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

# THINGS I PUT INTO CONSIDERATION AND LESSONS LEARNT:

While building the project, I took into consideration responsiveness on devices by ensuring I used a width and height for my container that would be clearly visible on both mobile devices and laptops.

By doing this project, I learnt how to use the :root element and variable colors. I was also able to demonstrate my understanding of the div element and how to center it properly.

- In future project, I would to pay more attention to the padding and margin details so as to give my webpage a more visual appealing effect and so the elements can appear properly placed.
